# Project 1: ArcGIS Story Map
## Scope
For this project, I hoped to explore some of these possibilities and identify associations that can be observed to be common among culprits of the capitol riot based on publicly available data. 
- chose to stick with associations to avoid inferring causality/meaning from patterns that may be subject to a lot of confounders. 
- This is meant to serve as a call for further investigations into the characteristics and inner workings of extremists who operate without being in close proximity to each other.
## Data:
- obtained data on the arrest location of culprits from the United States Department of Justice website (Capitol Breach Cases | USAO-DC | Department of Justice).
- created some data in ArcGis Pro by intersecting with built-in data sets (ACS data on population and poverty level in the US)  
## Processing:
After web scraping the data, I cleaned it up and geocoded the data in ArcGIS Pro. After which, I created layers using the data from living atlas. I exported feature classes, examined the attribute and field tables and deleted some attributes that I felt werenâ€™t pertinent to my project. I created two map views. In one of the views, I displayed the arrest locations using a heat map to improve the effectiveness of my analysis.
## Analysis:
- Ran in arcgis pro using the summarize within analytic tool. 
- This tool simply aggregated the datasets I had by state and ran a count on the number of crimes that had occured within each state.
